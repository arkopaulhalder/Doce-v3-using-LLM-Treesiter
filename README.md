# Doce-v3-using-LLM-Treesiter
## Overview
This project is a web application built using Flask that processes source code files in various programming languages to generate structured documentation. The application leverages the Tree-sitter library for parsing source code and extracting structural information such as functions, classes, and import statements. Additionally, it integrates with a Language Model (LLM) to generate detailed documentation and metadata for the parsed code.

## Key Features
1) Multi-language Support: The application supports multiple programming languages including Python, Java, C++, C, and JavaScript.
2) Code Parsing: Utilizes the Tree-sitter library to parse source code and extract structural elements.
3) Documentation Generation: Integrates with an LLM to generate structured documentation for the parsed code.
4) Code Search: Includes a code search engine to find similar code elements and provide context for the documentation.
5) REST API: Provides a RESTful API for processing code files and generating documentation.
